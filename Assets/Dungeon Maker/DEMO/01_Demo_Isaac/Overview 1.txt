In this scene the basic notions of Dungeon Maker are put into practice.
Pay attention to how alternative tools such as the Randomizer and the Rules are used.

As you can see, the rooms do not have to be exactly square, in this case they are rectangular.
But you can also combine different room sizes.
If you look closely, you can see that there is a smaller room on the map.

In essence, Dungeon Maker just places GameObjects next to each other as you have specified in the design.
How these GameObjects are connected depends on how you have configured your object.

This aspect makes Dungeon Maker very versatile and can easily adapt to any type of game.
Instead of rooms, you could make zones or areas in an open world, arrange objects on a board, whatever... the limit is your imagination.

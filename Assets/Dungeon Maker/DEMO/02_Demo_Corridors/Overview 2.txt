02_DEMO_CORRIDORS

In this scene, programming techniques are put into practice.
For this purpose I have created a special script (CorridorController).
It is in charge of orienting the corridors correctly to connect distant rooms.

If you prefer, you can analyze the script.
In this case, I want to run the script after the dungeon has been generated, for this I subscribe to the OnGeneratorFinish event.
Then, knowing the room type and using a custom enum to specify the shape (CorridorType), I can determine the correct orientation.

I recommend that you take a look at the DungeonObject and RoomObject scripts to find out all the information you can get to create your own functionality.

Another point to note about this scene is the Corridor room.
Open this room in the RoomEditor and see how it is configured.
Maybe you will get a better understanding of what the initials T, B, L, R and DEFAULT mean.

PS: to make use of Dungeon Maker in a script simply import the namespace: 
using DungeonMaker;

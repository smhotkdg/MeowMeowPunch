03_DEMO_ISLANDS

This extra scene I have created mainly to experiment.
In this case I imitate a game with islands.

For example the player can appear on a large island and be surrounded by small islands.
Passing from island to island he could reach a new big island where there is a treasure or whatever...
Each map would be different but they always have in common a big island surrounded by smaller islands that he has to visit, etc.

Something I would like to point out (although you have probably already noticed) is that there can be several designs in the same generator, like the one in this scene.
The generator will choose one randomly at the beginning of the generation.

With this in mind, you can manipulate the probabilities with which the designs are generated.
For example, if you want to make it more likely that design A will appear instead of design B, you can simply duplicate this item in the generator's list.
You can also put several generators in a randomizer.
If this way does not suit you, you can always modify the generator script as you please to suit your needs.
